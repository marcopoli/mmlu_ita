### Dataset Summary

[Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03300) by [Dan Hendrycks](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~hendrycks/), [Collin Burns](http://collinpburns.com), [Steven Basart](https://stevenbas.art), Andy Zou, Mantas Mazeika, [Dawn Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/), and [Jacob Steinhardt](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~jsteinhardt/) (ICLR 2021).

This is a massive multitask test consisting of multiple-choice questions from various branches of knowledge. The test spans subjects in the humanities, social sciences, hard sciences, and other areas that are important for some people to learn. This covers 57 tasks including elementary mathematics, US history, computer science, law, and more. To attain high accuracy on this test, models must possess extensive world knowledge and problem solving ability.
A complete list of tasks: ['abstract_algebra', 'anatomy', 'astronomy', 'business_ethics', 'clinical_knowledge', 'college_biology', 'college_chemistry', 'college_computer_science', 'college_mathematics', 'college_medicine', 'college_physics', 'computer_security', 'conceptual_physics', 'econometrics', 'electrical_engineering', 'elementary_mathematics', 'formal_logic', 'global_facts', 'high_school_biology', 'high_school_chemistry', 'high_school_computer_science', 'high_school_european_history', 'high_school_geography', 'high_school_government_and_politics', 'high_school_macroeconomics', 'high_school_mathematics', 'high_school_microeconomics', 'high_school_physics', 'high_school_psychology', 'high_school_statistics', 'high_school_us_history', 'high_school_world_history', 'human_aging', 'human_sexuality', 'international_law', 'jurisprudence', 'logical_fallacies', 'machine_learning', 'management', 'marketing', 'medical_genetics', 'miscellaneous', 'moral_disputes', 'moral_scenarios', 'nutrition', 'philosophy', 'prehistory', 'professional_accounting', 'professional_law', 'professional_medicine', 'professional_psychology', 'public_relations', 'security_studies', 'sociology', 'us_foreign_policy', 'virology', 'world_religions']

### Languages

English

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

An example from anatomy subtask looks as follows:
```
{
  "question": "What is the embryological origin of the hyoid bone?",
  "choices": ["The first pharyngeal arch", "The first and second pharyngeal arches", "The second pharyngeal arch", "The second and third pharyngeal arches"],
  "answer": "D"
}
```

### Data Fields

- `question`: a string feature
- `choices`: a list of 4 string features
- `answer`: a ClassLabel feature

### Data Splits

- `auxiliary_train`: auxiliary multiple-choice training questions from ARC, MC_TEST, OBQA, RACE, etc.
- `dev`: 5 examples per subtask, meant for few-shot setting
- `test`: there are at least 100 examples per subtask

|       | auxiliary_train   | dev | val | test |
| ----- | :------: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |
| TOTAL | 99842 | 285 | 1531 | 14042
